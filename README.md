- 👋 Hi, I’m @Josshhdc
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching myself to code to become a front end dev ( hopefully a back end dev eventually! )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of javascript :0
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small projects once i learn the basics of java, css, and html!
- 📫 How to reach me - im leaving this closed for now until i think i have learned enough to contribute to projcts :D
